## Responsive CSS 21 day challenge

# Week 1

- very easy so far, but super useful, already learned the difference b/w rem and em, I always thought the R in rem meant _relative_, it means root, so rem is always the same, you can use em's for padding because no matter the font size the button will always look good

- `display: inline-block`a button so it lines up with the text you have in the div
- overdo it with div's or semantic elements b/c that will make your structure easier as your app gets more complex
- margin: 0 stuff to get a base level of separation from elements, set the font size in the body using REM's (or pixels)
- width percentages work off of parents, so `width : 50%` for a child will make the child 50% of the parent element
